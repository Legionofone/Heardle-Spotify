<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<p>
This is another version of heardle made completely by me, wherein the user can choose freely regarding choice of song. For example: song by artist, song by playlist och a song from the user's top songs.
</p>

### Built With

<p>
The site runs on a local host, made using Node.js. Further, it's built using Spotify's Web API and the Spotify Web Playback SDK, where the user will have to authenticate using <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749">OAuth 2.0</a>.

### Installation

Start with downloading and extracting the zip-file. The application requires you to run it on a local server (this is done using Node.js and nodemon), thus you will therefore afterwards have to download these. In the your terminal, go to the directory of the project and then go to the folder named 'public' using this command: 

```sh
  cd public
  ```  
After that, install npm and nodemon in the current folder using the following two commands: 

```sh
  npm install 
  ```

```sh
  npm install -g nodemon
  ```
  
 The application should thne be playable by calling the command to start the server, then open up the server in your browser of choice at <a>http://localhost:8888</a>.
 
 ```sh
  nodemon server.js
  ```

It can be exited at anytime by using Ctrl+C in the terminal, or be refreshed by simply writing the following: 

```sh
  rs
  ```
